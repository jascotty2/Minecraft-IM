Provides classes aimed at making the process of using the client-to-client
protocols involved in sending files (via "Send File" and "Get File") and "Direct
IM" connections. Also provided are classes to aid in the use of the AOL Proxy
Server, a rather new feature of WinAIM, MacAIM, and iChat that allows two users
who are both behind a firewall to make direct connections (like for file
transfer) even though neither can accept incoming connections.
