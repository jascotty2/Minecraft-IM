Provides a set of classes to utilize AIM's "rate limiting" feature, which
prevents clients from sending commands too quickly. To simply calculate the
rate, one most likely wants {@link net.kano.joscar.ratelim.RateMonitor}. To
attempt to avoid being "rate limited," one should look into setting a {@link
net.kano.joscar.ratelim.RateLimitingQueueMgr} as the queue manager for a SNAC
processor.
