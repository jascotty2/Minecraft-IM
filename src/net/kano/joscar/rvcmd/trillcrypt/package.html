Provides a default implementation of the RV commands used in initializing and
communicating over an encrypted IM session via the protocol created by the
developers of <a href="http://trillian.cc" title="The website of the Trillian
IM client">Trillian</a>, an IM client for Windows.
<br>
<br>
Note that as of this writing, it is unknown how exactly the sessions are
encrypted. The Trillian website claims the encryption is Blowfish with a
key negotiated using a Diffie-Hellman system, but such a system seems not to
yield the correct results. This is probably due to something wrong with the key
exchange algorithm. Below is what is currently known about Trillian Encryption's
key exchange system:
<ul>

<li> Not enough arguments are passed between two clients to satisfy a true
Diffie-Hellman key exchange. In Diffie-Hellman, there are three variables
normally transmitted by one client, and one sent back by the other. The Trillian
Encryption protocol only transmits two and one. </li>

<li> It appears that the missing variable is <code>g</code>, the "generator" or
exponent base. This value appears to always be <code>5</code>. This was
discovered by passing in different modulus values in the {@link
net.kano.joscar.rvcmd.trillcrypt TrillianCryptReqRvCmd}: a value of
<code>5</code> causes Trillian to crash every time. This appears to be because
if the generator is <code>5</code> and the modulus is <code>5</code>,
<code>5<sup>x</sup> mod 5</code> is always <code>0</code>, which could
concievably cause Trillian to crash if it attempted to divide by that
value. </li>

<li> Normally, a Diffie-Hellman key exchange is <code>512</code> or
<code>1024</code> bits. In fact, the Sun JCE provider's implementation only
allows keys whose sizes are a multiple of <code>64</code> between those values.
This could be irrelevant; Diffie-Hellman can be performed with a key of any
size. </li>

<li> It seems, then, that it should be easy to implement Trillian Encryption
(with a working knowledge of Diffie-Hellman and the JCE's Blowfish
implementation, of course). However, the key exchange simply doesn't work with
the parameters specified above and in the protocol. Perhaps the generator is
actually some other number that happens to be a multiple of <code>5</code>.
Watch this space. </li>

</ul>

Note that the normal sequence of commands in a Trillian Secure IM connection is
as follows:
<ul>
<li> A: {@link net.kano.joscar.rvcmd.trillcrypt.TrillianCryptReqRvCmd} to request a session </li>
<li> B: {@link net.kano.joscar.rvcmd.trillcrypt.TrillianCryptAcceptRvCmd} to accept a session </li>
<li> A: {@link net.kano.joscar.rvcmd.trillcrypt.TrillianCryptBeginRvCmd} to begin the session <br> </li>
<li> A and B: {@link net.kano.joscar.rvcmd.trillcrypt.TrillianCryptMsgRvCmd}s containing message text <br> </li>
<li> A or B: {@link net.kano.joscar.rvcmd.trillcrypt.TrillianCryptCloseRvCmd} to close the connection </li>
</ul>
