Provides a set of classes to ease the use of a file transfer or Get File
connection. More specifically, this package provides the data structure used as
a "header" over a file transfer connection as well as a related checksum class.

<br>
Note that the Get File and Send File protocols are very similar in that they
both use the same header structure. For details, see {@link
net.kano.joscar.rvproto.ft.FileTransferHeader}.
