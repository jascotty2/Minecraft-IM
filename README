Minecraft Messenger (MinecraftIM)

Provides an Instant Messenger interface for your server
Intended for those who have a small server (like me) and want to know when a friend gets on

Features:

Single-user (for now?)
Supports: AIM (just AIM for now)
messages on player login & logoff
chat through IM

API :D

// to get plugin:
if (this.getServer().getPluginManager().isPluginEnabled("MinecraftIM")) {
	MinecraftIM messenger = (MinecraftIM) this.getServer().getPluginManager().getPlugin("MinecraftIM");
}
// to send messages to the main user:
messenger.sendNotify("message"); // will automatically format color formatting :)

// to intercept chat messages (will need the plugin as a libary in your manifest):
(your class)  implements ChatMessageHandler

public interface ChatMessageHandler {
    /**
     * Called when MinecraftIM receives a message from the authorized user
     * @param message what was received
     * @return if this method used the command, and don't do anything else
     */
    public boolean messageHandled(String message);
    /**
     * Called after any message received
     * @param fromUser what username this message came from
     * @param message what was received
     * @return if this method used the command, and don't do anything else
     */
    public boolean messageHandled(String fromUser, String message);
}
// then: 
messenger.registerMessageHandler(your class);


TODO:
add more protocols ?
if chat is turned off, turn on for a set time if send a chat message
-- find out how to send commands as an op, and retrieve the output from the command..
or: add more commands, maybe a custom command register method for API
more users to send notifications to ?
list of users to check for login (and ignore others) ?
