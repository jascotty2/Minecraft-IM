Provides implementations of <code>SnacCommand</code>s and associated command
factories for SNAC family <code>0x17</code>, the family of commands used during
the login or "authorization" sequence.
<br>
<br>
This package encapsulates the entire authorization process; the sequence of
commands is generally:
<ul>
<li> Client sends <code>KeyRequest</code> </li>
<li> Server replies with <code>KeyResponse</code> which contains an
<i>authorization key</i> </li>
<li> Client sends <code>AuthRequest</code>, encrypting his or her password using
the key given in the <code>KeyResponse</code> (joscar does the encryption for
you) </li>
<li> Server sends <code>AuthResponse</code>, indicating either an error code or
a server, port, and login cookie for "basic online service"
</ul>
