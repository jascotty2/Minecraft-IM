Provides a single <code>SnacCommand</code> and set of command factories for
handling SNAC error commands (command type <code>0x01</code>) in every family.
That is, no matter which family the command is in, if its command type is
<code>0x01</code>, it represents a SNAC error. See {@link
net.kano.joscar.snaccmd.error.SnacError} for details on error codes.
